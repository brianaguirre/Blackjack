# Blackjack
Blackjack Game for Flatiron School


Recreate a Blackjack game.
Comments contain login and simplified rules.
Assuming playing with one deck, and a set number to when players need to not ask for another card.


NOTE: 

Constant time complexity for creating deck.
Could improve random card finder, but using library for it under:
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>

Have not built the rules.
Need to check on the requirements.
